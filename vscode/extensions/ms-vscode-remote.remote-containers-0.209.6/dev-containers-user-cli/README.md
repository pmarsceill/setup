# Visual Studio Code devcontainer Command Line Interface

This package provides a stand-alone command line interface (CLI) for working with dev containers. This CLI allows you to build and run dev containers independently of Visual Studio Code, ideal for re-using dev containers in your build pipelines. See the [Remote-Containers CLI documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/devcontainer-cli) for more details on the `devcontainer` CLI.
